    The Rooks is made up of four Seattle-area musicians with deep roots 
    in Americana, Rock and Blues.
Their unique blend of soulful vocals, driving rhythm and dynamic two-pronged guitar virtuoso
 is truly inspiring.
</p>
<p class="song-body">
The band was originally known as Frank and the Big Shots and
played several Seattle venues, including the High Dive, Nectar, 
    the Horseshoe Saloon, 
    the Central Saloon down in Pioneer Square, and the Ballard Eagles.
 </p>
<p class="song-body">
    Now with a new lineup and all new music, the band continues to evolve 
and expand musical boundaries while staying true to their creative open spirit
and amazing musical journey.
